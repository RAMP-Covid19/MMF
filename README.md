# MMF
MMF is a Multiscale Modeling Framework to model the spread of Covid-19. This repository is currently under development and in future it will be merged with the source codes for the Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) program. Further changes to the repository will be made once the team, and the entry to the RAMP program is finalized.

The RAMP program is available at https://epcced.github.io/ramp/
